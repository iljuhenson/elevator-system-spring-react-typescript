## Assumptions made

1. The people who are using the elevator are assumed to be the ones
   who will immediately jump into the available for them elevator, even
   though it goes the opposite directions, because presumably people
   don't know which direction it goes.

## Algorithm logic

1. Generally all the elevators are working thanks to SCAN disk
   scheduling algorithm, but because there are more than 1 elevator
   some modifications have to be made.
